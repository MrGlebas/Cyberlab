# Hashing Tool - Coded by Mantvydas

Hey! This is a simple Python tool I made to hash stuff – strings or files – using popular cryptographic hash functions. Super handy if you want to check file integrity or just see what a hash looks like.

---

## What it does
- Hash **text strings** or **any file** (Word docs, PDFs, images, you name it).  
- Supports these algorithms: `md5`, `sha1`, `sha224`, `sha256`, `sha384`, `sha512`.  
- Easy command-line interface.  
- Works on big files too (reads in chunks, so no crashes).

---

## Requirements
- Python 3.x installed on your computer.  
- Basic comfort with running scripts in terminal or command prompt.

## How to use it
1. Run the script:
```bash
python hashing_tool.py
